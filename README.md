Talent Track Analyzer Using BERT

The Talent Track Analyzer is an AI-powered resume screening system that uses a fine-tuned BERT model to automatically extract and analyze key information from resumes, such as name, contact details, skills, education, and work experience. Designed to streamline recruitment, it processes resumes in formats like PDF or DOCX, cleans and tokenizes the text, and then uses BERT to understand the context of the content. It classifies resumes into job domains (e.g., Data Science, Web Development), performs skill matching by comparing candidate profiles with job descriptions, and scores resumes based on relevance, experience, and domain fit. The results are output in structured formats like JSON or CSV, and can be visualized through dashboards, helping recruiters quickly identify top candidates. This system reduces manual screening time, improves accuracy, and can be extended with features like multilingual support and ATS integration.
